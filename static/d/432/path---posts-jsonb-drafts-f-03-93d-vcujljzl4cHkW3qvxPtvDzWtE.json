{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Let's say we have an application where, in general, it makes sense to use a relational database. As an example, let's pretend we're running a coffee shop and our system takes care of managing inventory. We put this inventory data to a lot of different uses, from customer-facing use cases like building our menues to business-related use cases like budgeting and deciding what we should buy or not buy. A relational database is a nice fit here as, for each different type of use case, we're interested in different attributes of our data, and we want the flexibility to query our data based on different combinations of those attributes.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 20, 2018","path":"/posts/jsonb-drafts","title":"PostgreSQL Jsonb Use Case: Saving Drafts"}}},"pageContext":{}}
