{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The inspiration for my username is the Pixar film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)\">Ratatouille</a>, a story about rat named Remy with a passion for cooking. Being a rat, he has a rough go of it. All his fellow rats just see food as fuel, and every human Remy encounters sees nothing but a rat. Nonetheless, Remy persists, inspired by the motto of chef Auguste Gusteau: “Anyone can cook.”</p>\n<p>Becoming a software engineer has been much easier, in comparison. Yes, a liberal arts background is less traditional than a comp-sci degree, but it's not <em>that</em> unusual, particularly on the web-dev end of things. A handful of my colleagues have had no college degree at all. (One of them has gone on to work at a high level in one of the big tech companies.)</p>\n<p>I supposed I could claim that I'm \"self-taught,\" but that only feels true in a very narrow sense. Between all the <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/\">List Apart</a> articles, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> posts, tech meetups, books read, and colleagues I've worked with, it feels disengenous bordering on dishonest to call myself \"self-taught.\" If anything, I've had an embarrassing richness of teachers.</p>\n<p>So I'm inspired by Remy's story, but his story isn't mine. The weclome that I found in the web development community when I was first starting out is markedly different than the challenges faced by a rat who wants to be a chef.</p>\n<p>And yet, is that entirely true? In many way, the software industry is remarkably open. Meritocratic, even. A computer and an internet connection is enough to get you started. Study, practice, catch a few breaks, and people will actually pay you to write code. Get decently good and they'll even pay you real money. In this era of shrinking opportunities for the middle class, software engineering stands out as having an unusually low barrier to entry.</p>\n<p>Then again, if it's really that easy to get in the door, why is it that when I look around the office I mainly see people who look a lot like, well, me? Writing code is fun, and you can make a decent living doing it. Given that, wouldn't the expectation be that the world of tech look more like the world outside?</p>\n<p>Perhaps Remy's story isn't mine, not because cooking is so different from coding, but because while Remy doesn't look like a chef, I look like a \"coder.\"</p>\n<p>I think that, at its best, the tech culture <em>is</em> open and funny and welcoming and creative. At its best, it truly is a world where \"anyone can code.\" In choosing \"anyonecancode\" as my handle, I hope to both remind myself of how I've benefited from the generosity of my fellow developers, and to challenge myself to pay it forward and do my part to make this little corner of human activity as open and welcoming and fun for others, wherever they are coming from.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 13, 2018","path":"/posts/anyonecancode","title":"Anyone Can Code?"}}},"pageContext":{}}
