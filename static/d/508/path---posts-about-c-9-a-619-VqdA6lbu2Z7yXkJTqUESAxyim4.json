Before that, I was at <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/\">Spotify</a> for six and a half years, which came after a few years at a small digital agency called <a href=\"https://sanbornagency.com/\">Sanborn Media Factory</a>, which came after the first time I was ever paid to program, at <a href=\"https://www.teachforamerica.org/\">Teach For America</a>. Before that I was working temp jobs and going to grad school and wondering if moving to NYC \"just to see what it was like\" had been such a great plan after all. But it worked out, so the answer is \"yes.\"</p>\n<p>My roots are in the front end, but I spend a fair bit of time working with database, servers, back end APIs, and other server-side components. I've found that delivering a good user experience means making technical decision are focused on the user throughout all layers of the system. Does the UI do a good job letting the user know what's possible, and capture the user's intentions? Does the API allow for properly modeling that intent? Does the data persistence layer provide the needed reliability, efficiency, and flexibility to store and query these models? When something goes wrong, is the user left in the dark, or are they provided with alternate paths forward?</p>\n<p>In short, I try to make sure my technical decisions are optimizing for product, not process.</p>\n<p>The times I've been most successful at this have been with teams that prize collaboration and openness. Teams where I've had the chance to mentor and to be mentored, which practice strong intra-team communication practices such as documentation and constructive code reviews, and which expect (and find) leadership from all team members regardless of tenure, are invariably also the teams that have delivered most consistently on a great user experience.</p>\n<p>segue to working culture?\nClosely aligned with tha</p>\n<p>Cover: way I work,</p>\n<p>Tech I've use, tech I'm excited about\n..</p>\n<p>Some things I've worked wit</p>\n<p>jQuery, then Angular, these days a lot of React.
