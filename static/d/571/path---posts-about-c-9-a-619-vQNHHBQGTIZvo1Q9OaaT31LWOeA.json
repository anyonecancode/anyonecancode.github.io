{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I am a full-stack software engineer currently at <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/\">Audible</a>. Before that, I was at <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/\">Spotify</a> for six and a half years, which came after a few years at a small digital agency called <a href=\"https://sanbornagency.com/\">Sanborn Media Factory</a>, which came after the first time I was ever paid to program, at <a href=\"https://www.teachforamerica.org/\">Teach For America</a>. Before that I was working temp jobs and going to grad school and wondering if moving to NYC \"just to see what it was like\" had been such a great plan after all. But it worked out, so the answer is \"yes.\"</p>\n<p>I'm active throughout the stack, but I like to stay focused on the user experience. That means a lot of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, but also a lot of working with databases, servers, apis, and other server-side components because there's a lot more to delivering a good user experience serving up a web page.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 13, 2018","path":"/posts/about","title":"About"}}},"pageContext":{}}
